# Account API contract — reconciled

Authoritative wire contract for `/api/auth`, verified against the running QA
deployment and the API source rather than inferred from a written specification.
This client was originally built against the specification alone, and disagreed
with the service on most of what follows; where this document and the code
disagree, this document wins.

All bodies are JSON; property names are camelCase exactly as written here.
Errors are RFC 9457 problem documents with `application/problem+json` and a
`detail` string.

## Cross-site request protection

There is **no** CSRF token and no `sw5e_csrf` cookie. The API refuses any unsafe
method whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is not `same-origin` and whose `Origin` is not in
the configured allow-list, with a bodiless **403**. Confirmed live:

- no `Origin` header -> 403
- `Origin: https://evil.example` -> 403
- `Origin: https://sw5e.cfowers.io` -> 200

The browser sets `Origin` itself on same-origin state-changing fetches, so a
same-origin client needs to do nothing. Clients MUST NOT send `X-CSRF-Token`
and MUST NOT expect a readable CSRF cookie.

## Session

The session is an HttpOnly `__Host-` cookie, `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure`.
Never readable from script. `GET /api/auth/me` is the only way to read it.

Short-lived server-written state also travels in HttpOnly cookies:
`__Host-sw5e.enrol` (enrolment ticket), `__Host-sw5e.pk-register`,
`__Host-sw5e.pk-login` (WebAuthn challenges).

## `POST /api/auth/register` — 202

Request: `{ "email": string, "displayName": string }`

Response (identical whether or not the address exists):
```json
{ "status": "pending", "message": "If that address can be registered, ..." }
```

## `POST /api/auth/email/verify` — 200

Request: `{ "email": string, "token": string }`  <- **both fields required**

Response:
```json
{ "status": "verified", "enrollmentExpiresAt": "2026-08-30T19:52:11.123+00:00" }
```

**Verification does not sign you in.** It sets the enrolment-ticket cookie,
which authorises `passkey/register/begin` and `passkey/register/complete` for
the next 10 minutes and nothing else. `GET /api/auth/me` still answers 401.
This is how a new account enrols its first passkey; there is no dead end.
Invalid/expired token -> 400.

## `POST /api/auth/passkey/register/begin` — 200

No request body. Authorised by a session **or** an enrolment ticket.

Response is the WebAuthn creation options document **unwrapped** — there is no
`publicKey` envelope. Top-level keys are `rp`, `user`, `challenge`,
`pubKeyCredParams`, `timeout`, `excludeCredentials`, `authenticatorSelection`,
`attestation`, `hints`, `extensions`. It is exactly what
`PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON()` accepts.

401 when the caller has neither a session nor a ticket.

## `POST /api/auth/passkey/register/complete` — 201

Request: `{ "credential": <PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()>, "name": string|null }`
— the label field is **`name`**, not `label`.

Response:
```json
{ "credentialId": "base64url", "name": "Work laptop", "createdAt": "2026-...Z" }
```
`name` may be null. Completing enrolment does **not** sign you in; the client
follows it with an ordinary passkey sign-in.

## `POST /api/auth/passkey/login/begin` — 200

Request body is ignored entirely. The API never accepts an email address here
and always answers with an empty `allowCredentials`, so the response is
identical for every caller. **Clients must not offer an email field.**

Response is the request-options document **unwrapped**:
```json
{ "challenge": "...", "timeout": 120000, "rpId": "sw5e.cfowers.io",
  "allowCredentials": [], "userVerification": "required", "hints": [] }
```

## `POST /api/auth/passkey/login/complete` — 200

Request: `{ "credential": <PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()> }`

Response is one of:
```json
{ "status": "authenticated", "user": { ...CurrentUser } }
{ "status": "mfaRequired", "user": null }
```
Note the literal is **`mfaRequired`** (camelCase, no hyphen), and the
`mfaRequired` branch carries **no** `methods` array and no account detail at
all. Every failure is 401 with the same wording.

## `GET /api/auth/me` — 200

No envelope — the account object is the whole body:
```json
{
  "id": "0198e0...",
  "email": "reader@example.com",
  "displayName": "Jen Ordo",
  "roles": ["Community"],
  "twoFactorEnabled": false,
  "passkeys": [
    { "id": "base64url", "name": "Work laptop", "createdAt": "2026-...Z" }
  ]
}
```
- The field is **`twoFactorEnabled`**, not `mfa.totp`.
- `passkeys` is a list, not a count. `name` may be null.
- There is **no `lastUsedAt`**: the framework's passkey record does not track
  one, and inventing a value would be worse than omitting it.
- `roles` is sorted ordinal. The values are **`Community`**, **`Contributor`**,
  **`Administrator`** — capitalised, and the highest one is spelled
  `Administrator`, not `admin`. These are the names seeded into the database
  and used by the authorization policies.

401 when there is no session. It carries a problem document, but a client must
not depend on that: the refusal is raised by the authentication handler rather
than by the endpoint, and a reverse proxy in front of the service can answer
with no body at all. Decide the outcome from the status code and use the body
only to improve the message.

## `DELETE /api/auth/passkey/{credentialId}` — 200

Requires a session. `credentialId` is the base64url id, percent-encoded into
the path.

Response: `{ "status": "removed" }`

- 401 no session
- 404 no such credential on this account
- 409 `{ "code": "last-credential" }` when it is the only credential left —
  removing it would strand the account.

## `POST /api/auth/mfa/totp/enroll` — 200

Requires a session. No request body.
```json
{ "sharedKey": "abcd efgh ijkl mnop", "authenticatorUri": "otpauth://totp/..." }
```
Fields are **`sharedKey`** and **`authenticatorUri`**. Two-factor is not on yet.

## `POST /api/auth/mfa/totp/verify` — 200

Request: `{ "code": "123456" }`

One endpoint, two jobs, selected by server-written cookie state and never by
the body:

- caller holds the pending two-factor cookie (mid sign-in):
  `{ "status": "authenticated", "user": { ...CurrentUser } }`
- caller has a session (finishing enrolment):
  `{ "status": "enabled", "recoveryCodes": ["...", ... 10 items] }`

The enrolment literal is **`enabled`**, not `enrolled`. Recovery codes **are**
returned, exactly once, and only here. Wrong code -> 400 on the enrolment
branch, 401 on the sign-in branch.

## `POST /api/auth/logout` — 204

Anonymous and idempotent. Clears the session plus every half-finished flow.

## `PUT /api/auth/admin/users/{userId}/roles` — 200

Administrators only. Declares the full desired role set; anything absent is
revoked.

Request: `{ "roles": ["Contributor"] }` — only `Contributor` and
`Administrator` may be assigned. `Community` is the floor every account stands
on and is rejected.
Response: `{ "userId": "guid", "roles": ["Community", "Contributor"] }`

400 unknown role, 401, 403 not an administrator, 404 no such account.
